# Plan C — Execution Progress

This file is the resumable hand-off log for executing `plan-C-strategist-v2.md` via
`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. It travels with the branch, so any future
session can `git checkout` the branch, read this file alongside the plan, and continue
exactly where the previous session stopped.

**How to read this file:**
- Tasks are listed in plan order (C1 → C16).
- `[ ]` means not started. `[x]` means landed (with the commit SHA).
- "In flight" means a subagent was dispatched but did not finish — re-dispatch fresh.
- The **Chunks** table groups tasks by branch / risk seam. Each chunk is its own branch
  off main and its own short-lived worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`.

## Chunks

| Chunk | Tasks | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Chunk 1 — Strategist-internal foundation** | C1–C6 | `phase4/planC-foundation` | in flight |
| Chunk 2 — Strategist rewrite | C7–C9 | (not started) | — |
| Chunk 3 — Persistence + wiring | C10–C14 | (not started) | — |
| Chunk 4 — Verify | C15–C16 | (not started) | — |

Rationale for the split is in the session notes / conversation; in short, Plan C is
described in the spec as "high risk" because it touches the strategist prompt + agent
+ pipeline + executor + ORM. Splitting along the natural integration seams gives clean
stop-points to review, push, and pause between sessions.

## Chunk 1 — `phase4/planC-foundation`

All six tasks here are purely additive: new modules and tests under
`src/agents/strategist/`, plus one field added to `PositionThesis`. Nothing yet imports
the new modules, so the bot still runs identically to the post-Plan-B merge.

**Execution model:** subagent-driven-development. Each task gets one Sonnet implementer
subagent + one Sonnet spec-compliance reviewer + one Sonnet code-quality reviewer. After
all six tasks land, one Opus reviewer audits the chunk as a whole before this branch is
proposed for merge into main.

**Pre-flight:**
- Worktree: `.claude/worktrees/phase4-planC-chunk1` (this directory)
- Branch: `phase4/planC-foundation` off `main @ 19a12b7`
- Venv: symlinked from the main repo's `.venv` (Python 3.14, pydantic 2.13.4)

**Tasks:**

- [x] **C1** — Add `stance_schema.py` (`TickerStance` model). Plan §C1. — `a09d614`
- [x] **C2** — Add `lifecycle.py` (`derive_lifecycle_action`). Plan §C2. — `55966c8` (+`e6ac789` docstring fix)
- [x] **C3** — Add `PositionThesis.opened_tick_id` field. Plan §C3. — `79a15ac`
- [x] **C4** — Add `derivation.py` (`derive_legacy_fields`). Plan §C4. — `ef319b3` (+`cd84aa9` docstring clarification)
- [ ] **C5** — Add `held_view.py` (`render_held_positions_view`). Plan §C5.
- [ ] **C6** — Add `evidence_view.py` (render `TickerEvidence`). Plan §C6.
- [ ] **Final review** — Opus audit of all six tasks together.

Each task is committed individually with a Conventional-Commits message; this file is
updated to mark `[x] Cn — <sha>` before the next task is dispatched.

## Session log

A short, append-only log of what happened in each session. New sessions append a dated
entry; do not rewrite history.

### 2026-05-11 — chunk 1 dispatched
- Created branch `phase4/planC-foundation` off `main @ 19a12b7`.
- Created this progress file as the first commit on the branch.
- Dispatching C1 implementer (Sonnet).

### 2026-05-11 — C1 landed (`a09d614`)
- Spec compliance: ✅ — schema fields, constraints, and 9 required tests match spec exactly. Test path `tests/unit/agents/strategist/` chosen over the plan's `tests/unit/strategist/` to match the repo's existing `tests/unit/agents/analysts/` convention; authorised deviation.
- Code quality: ⚠️ approved with minor issues. One Important finding (ticker field unvalidated — accepts `""` or whitespace) **deferred**: the plan and Plan A's `AnalystEvidence`/`TickerEvidence` schemas all spec `ticker: str` bare. Tightening it here without doing so across the family creates a one-off inconsistency. **Backlog candidate**: introduce a shared `Ticker` type alias (e.g. `Annotated[str, Field(min_length=1, pattern=...)]`) and apply across `contract/` and `strategist/` in one pass — out of scope for chunk 1.
- Three Minor cosmetic findings noted and not actioned (test assertion completeness, unrealistic `catalyst="Q3"` value, module-docstring brevity). All would be trivial follow-ups if the file ever opens for another reason.

### 2026-05-11 — C2 landed (`55966c8` + `e6ac789`)
- Spec compliance: ✅ — five-branch lifecycle math implemented exactly as specified; all 10 required tests present and passing.
- Code quality: ⚠️ approved with one Important docstring defect (test_close_at_exact_epsilon_boundary docstring described the case as "close" while asserting "hold"). The wording came from the plan's literal Python snippet — a plan-level wording defect rather than an implementation oversight. Controller applied the reviewer's verbatim suggested fix directly (`e6ac789`) rather than spinning up another implementer + 2 reviewers for a 1-line docstring edit. Tests still pass (22/22 across C1+C2).
- One Minor style note noted, not actioned: the inner `if held and wants_held:` guard is technically redundant given the preceding early returns, but the inline comment explains it and the structure aids readability. Leaving as-is.

### 2026-05-11 — C3 landed (`79a15ac`)
- Spec compliance: ✅ — one-line additive field on `PositionThesis` with `str = ""` default; 2 tests assert default and JSON round-trip. Strategist test suite at 24 green.
- Code quality: ✅ approved (no issues). Field placement, inline comment scope, and `datetime.UTC`/UP017 usage all clean.
- Authorised deviation noted: implementer used `datetime.UTC` (Python 3.11+ shortcut) instead of the plan's `timezone.utc` for ruff UP017 compliance. Functionally identical.

### 2026-05-11 — C4 landed (`ef319b3` + `cd84aa9`)
- Spec compliance: ✅ — `TickContext`/`DerivedFields` frozen dataclasses + pure `derive_legacy_fields` function exactly as specified. All six required tests present, plus one implementer-added test for the `add` lifecycle branch (test count = 7, within ≤8 cap). Strategist regression at 31/31 green.
- Code quality: ⚠️ approved with two Minor issues. One actioned (`cd84aa9` adds a Note to `DerivedFields` docstring explaining that `frozen=True` doesn't deep-freeze dict contents — read-by-convention). One declined (multi-stance test could assert PositionThesis fields, not just membership — covered elsewhere; opportunistic).
- Authorised deviations: `from collections.abc import Iterable` (UP035), `datetime.UTC` (UP017), removed unused `DerivedFields` import from test file (F401).
