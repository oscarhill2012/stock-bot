"""YieldingAnalystWrapper — BaseAgent that proxies an inner agent and emits
the inner's evidence write as a yielded ``state_delta``.

Used to convert the existing Fundamental and News LlmAgent's after-callback
direct-mutation evidence write into a Rule-1-conformant
``Event(actions=EventActions(state_delta=…))`` yield.

The wrapper:
1. Delegates to the inner agent (an ``LlmAgent`` plus its callbacks).  All
   intermediate events from the inner agent are forwarded unchanged.
2. After the inner agent returns, reads the evidence list from
   ``ctx.session.state[evidence_state_key]`` and yields one new event whose
   ``state_delta`` carries that list under the same key.

The result: even though the inner LlmAgent's after_agent_callback wrote
directly to state (it has to — ADK callbacks cannot yield events), the
outer wrapper republishes the write as a proper ``state_delta`` so ADK's
``SessionService.append_event`` persists it.  The inner direct write
becomes redundant with the outer yield — kept defensively for one cycle
so that consumers in the same invocation continue to see the value
without waiting for the event flush.

A future cleanup can drop the inner direct mutation once the persistence
layer is wired and all session backends honour ``state_delta`` writes
identically.
