"""TickerStance — the strategist's per-ticker decision substrate.

**Single canonical form (Band 3).**

The strategist emits one ``TickerStance`` per watchlist ticker on every tick.
Each stance carries an ``intent`` verb and the fields required for that verb;
there is no legacy dual-form — the old ``preferred_weight`` / ``conviction`` /
``close_reason`` / ``trim_reason`` fields have been deleted.

``derive_decision_fields`` reads a list of stances and produces the flat
``target_weights``, ``close_reasons``, and ``trim_reasons`` fields that
downstream agents expect.

The stance is *not* a trade instruction. It expresses the strategist's desired
portfolio position and the reasoning behind it. The executor translates that
desire into actual orders.

Consumers:
- ``derive_decision_fields`` (C4) — flattens stances into the canonical output shape
- ``StrategistDecision`` (C7) — embeds the stance list in the decision payload
- The after-callback (C9) — validates stances before persisting
- ``TickerStanceRow`` (C10) — persists each stance to the database

Verb vocabulary (Spec B — Band 3, single canonical form)
---------------------------------------------------------
The ``intent`` field is the canonical action verb and is **required** on every
stance.  Verb-conditional field requirements:

    open   — enter flat → held; broker BUY to ``weight``.
             Required: weight, rationale, horizon, target_price, stop_price.
             Optional: catalyst.

    add    — increase existing position; broker BUY delta to ``weight``.
             Required: weight.
             Optional: reason, horizon, target_price, stop_price, catalyst.

    trim   — reduce existing position (not to zero); broker SELL delta.
             Required: weight, reason.

    close  — full exit; broker SELL all.
             Required: reason.
             Forbidden: weight (use 'trim' for a partial exit).

    hold   — no trade; review fields only.
             Required: reason.
             Forbidden: weight.

    update — no trade; mutate thesis fields only.
             Required: reason + at least one of
             target_price / stop_price / catalyst / horizon.
             Forbidden: weight.

        weight:       Post-stance portfolio weight in ``[0, 1]``.  Required for
                      open/add/trim; forbidden on close/hold/update.

        horizon:      Investment horizon.  Required on ``open``; optional on
