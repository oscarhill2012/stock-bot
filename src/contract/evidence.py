"""Per-analyst evidence types — code-only digest substrate.

Each analyst returns one AnalystEvidence per ticker per tick. The deterministic
aggregator in `contract.digest` collapses the four analysts' evidence into one
TickerEvidence per ticker.

The schema below is the same shape that Plan D persists to SQLite, so the
contract is identical from Plan A through Plan D. Several fields exist to
support the future knowledge-base / learning loop (see backlog B2):

- `magnitude` is independent of `confidence` so per-evidence-key weighting
  (backlog B5) can learn that some feature ranges matter more than others.
- `key_factors` survives JSON round-tripping and is the structured pattern-
  recall primitive the KB will key off.
